# Gradius

## Context 
As part of my education at Isart Digital Montreal.As a bonus project, we had the chance to experiment applying math functions such as Sin and Cos to enemy mouvement. 

## Specifications
* Use C++ programming language
* Use the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library for display.
* Enemies should move in a sin or cos like wave function.
* As a bonus for playability I have added:
    * Player hitting enemy increaded score.
    * Enemy hitting player resets the schore.
    * Player bullets also shoot in a cos like wave.
    * Parallax Background for fun.

## How to run the game
* Download the project.
* Open the SpaceInvaders.sln file.
* Change architecture from x64 to x32.
* Run and enjoy.

## Key take aways
* parameterization of cos to change amplitude and period.
* Parralax effect and infinite background scrolling.
